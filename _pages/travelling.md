I started documenting my travels when we arrived in Bangkok at the start of a 7 month trip around the world in 2009/10. Writing the posts really kept me busy during the down times, like the long bus rides but more than that, I thoroughly enjoyed writing them.

Now, years after the trip, I am so glad I have documentary evidence of all of the places we visited, things we saw and experiences we had. Sometimes I read some of them back and there are still parts that I realise I&#8217;d have forgotten had I not written about them.
