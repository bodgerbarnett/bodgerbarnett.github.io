After his latest embarrassment on the football pitch yesterday afternoon, are there any Arsenal fans remaining with any sympathy whatsoever for Emmanuel Eboue?

I don&#8217;t care that he&#8217;s apparently a sensitive soul. I don&#8217;t care that he was upset by being booed. I don&#8217;t care that he&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/feb/07/interview-emmanuel-eboue-arsenal" target="_blank">god-fearing, Christian man who loves his children</a>. He&#8217;s not good enough to be an Arsenal player.

At times yesterday he looked almost passable as a football player! There is no doubt whatsoever that referee Mike Dean made a very bad mistake when disallowing his goal midway through the first half. He hardly touched Woodgate, who fell down because of the players at his feet rather than any physical contact from our goalscorer but Mr. Dean is a wonderful example of a &#8220;homer&#8221; referee, the likes of which are never seen around N5.

When Eboue was shown his 2nd yellow card, most Arsenal supporters in the pub I was in were aghast &#8211; no-one could believe that he had done anything to deserve to be sent off and I think most people were ready to direct more anger at the referee. Until, after what seemed like an age, Sky managed to get round to showing the incident which led up to it &#8211; at which point the shred of sympathy that we all had for the man evaporated and was replaced by the usual disillusioned faces and various expletives being used to describe Eboue&#8217;s behaviour.

As I&#8217;ve said all along, when we booed him during the Wigan game, it was for one reason and one reason alone &#8211; he&#8217;s not good enough and he shouldn&#8217;t be in our squad any more.

Get rid of him, Arsene.
