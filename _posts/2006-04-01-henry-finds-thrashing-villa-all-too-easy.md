If Thierry Henry leaves Arsenal this summer, then I believe that it is games like this that will have made his mind up.

Obviously, most Gooners will have enjoyed seeing David O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s latest crop of &#8216;youngsters&#8217; at his latest &#8216;small club&#8217; being completely outplayed by another superb Arsenal performance &#8211; but, without meaning to be patronising, I get the feeling that Thierry finds this sort of game quite dull and possibly a bit too easy.

Just like the previous home game in the league, against Charlton, he looked a little bored &#8211; trying trick after trick to create or score even better and better goals to entertain himself (and us!). Surely the novelty of this will wear off soon and he will look to the Primera Liga for some more challenging days out?

If he does, it will be a great shame, as he is certainly the most entertaining player I have ever seen at Highbury and he would be sorely missed. His first goal today was a superb lob over Sorensen as the goalkeeper came rushing out to meet a long ball from Reyes. And his second was, for me, classic Henry. Another long ball forward saw Adebayor skillfully touch the ball back to Thierry who had dropped back in anticipation. Every single person in the ground knew what he was going to do but despite this, there was no way any of us could have stopped the shot that he produced &#8211; top right hand corner at pace &#8211; not even Sorensen.

However, from what I&#8217;ve seen of the other members of the squad lately, we may have more than enough to cope without the great man.

With Fabregas taken off injured after only 16 minutes, Abou Diaby looked good today in his place, as did Adebayor and even Gilberto&#8217;s passing was acceptable today! Van Persie has a hunger for the ball which is good to see and in Mathieu Flamini, Arsene seems to have uncovered another gem &#8211; his performances at left back are good enough for some Gooners to consider whether Ashley Cole will get back in the side when he&#8217;s fit again! And remember, he is right-footed and was purchased as a midfielder! The same as Mister Toure, who was rock solid as ever today.

All in all, it was an excellent performance against a very poor Villa side with no excuse for not getting stuck in. We could have scored more but for some mistakes up front and some very good saves from Sorensen, but 5-0 will do, thank you very much.

I really hope he stays to see in the new stadium and to guide these youngsters to future glories, but I just have this nagging feeling that the lack of competitition in the Premiership will see us looking for a new number 14 next season.
