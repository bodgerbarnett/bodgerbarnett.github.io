Before the start of this season I watched a lot of youtube clips of Eduardo, which led to me waxing lyrical about how good our new signing was. This was met with indifference from my fellow fans, as he took a while to settle in. Unfortunately I am far too smug a person not to keep reminding them of this now that they agree with me on Eduardo&#8217;s merits!

Anyway, I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of research on Carlos Vela, the 18 year old Mexican player who is currently on loan from us to Osasuna. He is being spoken of quite highly by Guillam Balague, the Spanish football pundit. This clip, of his first goal for Osasuna, shows a player who is pacey, skillful, can pass well and has good movement.



He can play as an attacking midfielder, either on the left or in the centre. Once his work permit comes through he will come back to Arsenal, probably for next season.I think he could be a good understudy for Rosicky on the left side of midfield next season. Who knows, if he adapts well to the Premiership, he may even become a regular in the side.Remember where you heard it first &#8230;..
