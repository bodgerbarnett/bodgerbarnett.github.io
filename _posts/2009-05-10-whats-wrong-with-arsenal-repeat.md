There is nothing new to say about today&#8217;s performance that hasn&#8217;t already been said in a hundred posts on this and almost every Arsenal website over the past 2 or 3 years.

Usual stuff &#8211; Diaby and Adebayor aren&#8217;t good enough, the defence needs strengthening, we need a holding midfielder, some experience all over the pitch, more commitment, a proper leader and some more clinical finishing up front.

Same old, same old. Dull, dull, dull.
