Well, not much to say about this game really.  
For me, it was a typical Champions League game &#8211; far too much cagey defending and not enough players willing to take risks to get the result they needed.

But hey! For once, it wasn&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">us</span> that needed the goals and the result!

We&#8217;d already done all the hard work required to win this tie in the first leg &#8211; 2-0 looked like it might not be enough, given that we could have scored more and Juve ended the game with 9 men. But it seems that, much like many of the other Italian sides I have seen recently, Juve haven&#8217;t got the desire to fight back from a 2 goal deficit &#8211; even if they had a whole game to do it and were playing at home!

They hardly created a single opportunity to win it, let alone the minimum 3 that they needed!  
In truth, Arsenal looked more like scoring for most of the night.

So, job done, and a draw against a different side altogether in Villareal.  
Having watched them beat Inter Milan (one of the gutless Italians mentioned above) they do look a class side. Riquelme and Sorin in particular looked very dangerous and Forlan looks like a different man to the useless lump that tried in vain to score repeatedly for United.

Having said that, we can definitely beat them over 2 legs and then it&#8217;ll Paris in the Spring!
