So after 16 years, UEFA have, at long last, expanded their second string competition enough to allow Tottenham to join in.

Tonight, they managed to beat the 8th best team in the Czech Republic by 1 goal to nil, so well done to the Tiny Totts for that.

As you would imagine, their fans approached the game with the same adrenalin-fuelled excitement that you might expect to see from Accrington Stanley supporters during an afternoon at Old Trafford in the FA Cup 3rd round.

I hope Martin Jol and his boys enjoyed their nice day out &#8211; Tottenham can now hold their heads up high and proudly announce that they are as big a club as Middlesborough or Bolton.

Congratulations, Tottenham.
