It seems that, whilst I was writing my previous post, Mister Wenger was telling everyone in the media that:-

> The team played exceptionally well &#8211; maybe the best Champions League game since I have been here.

<span style="font-size: 100%">So it turns out that I was right &#8211; he is indeed more interested in playing nice football than he is in winning football matches. Well, as I said last night, as long as we&#8217;re clear &#8211; now we can approach being Arsenal fans in a completely different way. We can pay our money, go along, and sit back and watch the entertainment of the dancing footballers. There is always Riverdance as an alternative during the close season, I suppose.</span>
