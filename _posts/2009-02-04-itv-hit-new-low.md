I have never been the greatest fan of ITVs coverage of football. Actually, I tell a lie, I&#8217;ve always hated them. Let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; their commentators, their pundits, their presentation &#8211; its all rubbish.

But tonight they surpassed themselves and managed to show 2 adverts _during_ the last 2 minutes of extra time in a drab 0-0 draw between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park, returning to the action _just in time_ for us to witness the Everton players celebrating having scored the only goal of the entire night of football!

Their website is festooned with adverts for their iPlayer clone which carry the slogan &#8220;Amazing telly you can&#8217;t miss&#8221; &#8211; they really couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.

Idiots.
