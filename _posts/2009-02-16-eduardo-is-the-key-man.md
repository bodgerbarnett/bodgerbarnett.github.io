I have thought this for some time but Eduardo is the key to our season now in my opinion.

If Martin Taylor hadn&#8217;t broken his leg this time last year, I feel sure we would have won the league and, as long as he stays fit, he is crucial in this season&#8217;s battle to finish 4th and qualify for the Champions League.

One could argue that the opposition was poor tonight, and it was &#8211; Cardiff played like Sheffield United or Wigan did in the Carling Cup &#8211; too much respect and not good enough in possession, they let us play and paid for it. But Eduardo, starting for the first time since his horrific injury in Birmingham, showed why he is so important to us at the current time.

He brings so much to the team, its difficult to say which asset is the most important.

  * His movement, even after a year out, is superb &#8211; he always wants the ball and never stops running
  * He has a natural ability that shows in almost every touch he has &#8211; his control is superb and his awareness is very sharp indeed
  * He has an eye for goal and isn&#8217;t afraid to shoot when he gets the opportunity &#8211; something that is in _very_ short supply in the current Arsenal side
  * Overall, the way he plays seems to give the rest of the team confidence &#8211; again, something which has really been lacking this season

A special mention tonight must go to Nicklas Bendtner &#8211; he had a superb game tonight, never stopped running and linked up play extremely well at times, winning a lot of headers too. That&#8217;s why I think that it is that final point &#8211; the confidence he brings to the side &#8211; that is the most important aspect of his presence. Other players will perform better with him in the team.

Catching Aston Villa (or Chelsea!) is going to be very tough, but if we are to do it, Eduardo is going to have to play a key role in our fightback.

Good to see you back, Eddie!
