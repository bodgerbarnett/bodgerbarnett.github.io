_An iPhone application which can be used to browse recipes, order ingredients with the click of a button and carry out your online shopping at Tesco._

In July 2010, a friend and I created an iPhone app using the Tesco Grocery API and the recipes available on the Tesco website.

Users could log into their Tesco Online accounts and browse for recipes, automatically adding all the necessary ingredients to their online shopping baskets at the touch of a button. We also added a section which could be used to select any item available through the Tesco Grocery website.

The entire purchase and delivery process could be managed using the app, which only cost 59p.

The app is still available from the Recipe Shopper <a href="http://recipeshopperapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>  despite the fact that we are no longer developing or actively selling the app.
