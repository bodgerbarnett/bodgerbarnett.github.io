_The official website of the Dulwich Hamlet Supporters&#8217; Trust._

While taking photographs for The Real FA Cup at Champion Hill (Dulwich&#8217;s home ground) one day, I got chatting to one of the fans. It turned out he was a member of the board of the club&#8217;s supporters&#8217; trust and they were looking for someone to help them update their very old-fashioned website.

Happy to help, I redesigned the site and set them up with a Twitter account and a Facebook page as well as an online shop.

Since setting up the new site, the number of Trust members has soared &#8211; many of the newer members are younger supporters who are interested in getting involved with the club. The sales of club merchandise have gone through the roof with the addition of the online shop and the club as a whole is thriving.
